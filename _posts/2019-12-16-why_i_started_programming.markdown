  *"Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves." *    

         -Henry David Thoreau

      I always thought programming was this secret thing only highly intelligent, compter savvy, expiditious typers could comprehend. It wasn't until I became friends with a software engineer that those stereotypes began to breakdown. 
			
			I had struggled to find my passion and career. I'm in my early 20's and going to college, trying to take as many classes in subjects that interest me, hoping to find that spark. My problem is I have too many interest and can't seem to land on one. The subjects that lure me in have always been English, History, and Psychology. I desperatly needed to find something that would challange me and always make me learn new things. I just didn't quite like the idea of having to spend years in school. After reading some books about the minds of programmers and how the industry has changed over the decades, I decided to give the free boot-camp a try.
			
			The journey so far has been a constant battle with frustration and motivation. So much of learning to program is just doing it and having the patience to be wrong, and being okay with that. From what my friend tells me that doesn't go away, even years into working in the industry. I research in my free time what part of the industry I find most interesting and so far that is cybersecurity. I hope to finish this program and use this deep understanding of programming as a background to go into cybersecurity. Wish me luck!
